# taxPProValidation

A repo for testing some validation strategies for bugphyzz

aerophilicity   X
growth temperature  X
disease association X   Note: Too many attributes. Only use the table of AUC values.
biosafety level X   Note: Some biosafety data (sp) couldn't be used for auc beacause there were too few holdouts (like 5).
gram stain X Note: Very low auc values.
shape   X   Note: AUC was good for some and not so good for others (ranks).
motility    X   Note: good auc values.
arrangement X   Note: Bad auc values. Possibly too many individual attributes. Maybe I'll just use the tables for these ones.
