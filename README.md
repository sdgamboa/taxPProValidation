# taxPProValidation

A repo for testing some validation strategies for bugphyzz

aerophilicity   X
growth temperature  X
disease association X   Note: Too many attributes. Only use the table of AUC values.
biosafety level X   Note: Some biosafety data (sp) couldn't be used for auc beacause there were too few holdouts (like 5).
gram stain X Note: Very low auc values.
